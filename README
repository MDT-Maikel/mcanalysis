### Monte Carlo Analysis ####
#############################

A set of C++ files which form a small library to perform analyses on different types of files produced
by Monte Carlo generators. The file types are all based on a common <particle> class and inherit from it.

Based on the <particle> class there will be an <event> class containing a list of particles. Event 
samples can be constructed by making a vector of <event> objects. 

On these event samples one can perform basic analyses like cut and count. For this we produced the <cut>
class in which one can implement an analysis.

### Particle Class ###
######################
The <particle> class serves as a base class for different object formats like .lhco and .lhe. These formats
are then derived classes from the <particle> class called <lhco> and <lhe>.
