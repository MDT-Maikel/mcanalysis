### Unit Tests ###
##################
A suit of basic test programs which test the mc analysis source code in the
folder "/source".

Compile all unit tests by writing in a shell:

	cd mcanalysis/tests
	make

Then compile and run a single test by writing:

	make test_<name of test>	
	./test_<name of test>

Or compile run all tests by writing:

	make test

At all times all tests should compile and return success on running.


####################
### Organization ###
####################
All unit tests should consist of a single .cpp file which tests a single 
class or structure in "/source". Outputs like files or images should be 
placed in the folder "/output". The executables reside in the main folder
"/tests" itself. Some of the tests require input file, which have to be 
place in the filer "/input". A list of required files is given by:

	test_lhco_events.lhco.gz	1k random LHCO events
	test_lhe_events.lhe.gz		1k random LHE events
	test_plot_events.lhco.gz	50k LHCO events with met and ht
	test_plot_events.lhe.gz		50k LHE events with met and ht
