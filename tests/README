### Unit Tests ###
##################
A suit of basic test programs which test the mc analysis source code in the
folder "/source".

Compile all unit tests by writing in a shell:

	cd mcanalysis/tests
	make

Then run the tests by writing

	./test_<name of test>

At all times all tests should compile and return success on running.


####################
### Organization ###
####################
All unit tests should consist of a single .cpp file which tests a single 
class or structure in "/source". Outputs like files or images should be 
placed in the folder "/output". The executables reside in the main folder
"/tests" itself.
